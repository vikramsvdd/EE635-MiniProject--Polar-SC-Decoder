# EE635-MiniProject--Polar-SC-Decoder
Hello Guys, Welcome to my repo. Me along with my teammate Tathagat have developed a custom Polar Encoder and Successive Cancellation (SC) Decoder using Matlab. Polar Codes are actively used in Control Signalling in 5GNR and its been great to custom implement that ourselves. Checkout the code and hope you enjoy!
